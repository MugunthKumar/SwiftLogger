# SwiftLogger
This is version 0.1 of SwiftLogger, A Logging framework written Swift

###Features
* Simple, clean and elegant log framework written in Swift
* Automatically prefixes function name and line number
* Uses emoji üòÄ for easier reading of console log
* Supports [XcodeColors] (https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors)

###Installation
As easy as copying ```Log.swift``` into your project and start using it.

###How to use
You just start calling the methods ```info```, ```warn``` or ```error``` to log a message onto the console.

####Example
```
Log.error("Error")
Log.warn("Warning")
Log.info("Information")
```
displays
```
application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) [20] üö´Errorüö´
application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) [21] ‚ö†Ô∏èWarning‚ö†Ô∏è
application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) [22] ‚úÖInfo‚úÖ
```
on your Xcode Console

Version 0.1 ships with two logs, an emoji log and a Xcode Colors log. Emoji log is set to default.
If you are using Xcode Colors plugin, use the following code
```
Log.xcodeColorsLog.info("Error")
Log.xcodeColorsLog.warn("Warning")
Log.xcodeColorsLog.error("Info")
```

###Setting the default behaviour
By setting the ```defaultLog``` property, you can customize the way your logs are formatted. 
```
Log.defaultLog = Log.xcodeColorsLog
```
Once you set the default log, ```Log.info```, ```Log.warn``` and ```Log.error``` methods will use ```xcodeColorsLog```.

###Custom Logging

You can also create your own custom loggers 

```
let customLog = Log(
  infoPrefix: "~~~ ", infoSuffix: " ~~~",
  warnPrefix: "!!!", warnSuffix: " !!!",
  errorPrefix: "XXX ", errorSuffix: " XXX")
  
customLog.info("Info")
customLog.warn("Warning")
customLog.error("Error")
```
displays
```
application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) [20] ~~~ Info ~~~
application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) [21] !!! Warning !!!
application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) [22] XXX Error XXX
```
on your Xcode Console

Custom logging can be used in more powerful ways. 
For example, you can use different loggers for different builds within your application
